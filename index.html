  <h1>PoloniexShowBTCWorth</h1>
  <p>Excuse the lack of design here, barebones setup on Github in order to create a bookmarket link that can be saved</p>

  <h2>What is a "Bookmarklet"</h2>
  <p>A Bookmarklet is a bookmark that can run an action. Normal bookmarks are pages on the web that you want to favorite, or
    save for later. A Bookmarklet is similar, as you can click it like a normal bookmark, but instead of redirecting you
    to wherever you saved, it would instead run JavaScript on the current website.</p>
  <p>Generally, bookmarklets are quick actions that can assist you with whatever it is you want help with. This can be risky of course,
    because JavaScript can make requests and run actions on your behalf (your current browising session) and you put faith into whatever
    the action it is doing.</p>

  <h2>So what is this PoloniexShowBTCWorth?</h2>
  <p>It is a bookmarklet that, when clicked, will update the rows of altcoins on the Poloniex exchange and show the altcoin's current price
    along with the most recent USD/BTC BUY order made on Poloniex through their API.</p>
  <p>It will essentially show you an altcoin's USD price (in btc) which will help you determine the worth of a coin. It is not necessary but it is
    a feature I personally wish it had so this is why I made it</p>

  <h2>Is there an open source for this?</h2>
  <p>There is, and it is open source to allow you to verify the integrity of this Bookmarklet. You can also inspect the bookmarklet below and view the
    URL contents to ensure it is 100% safe. It is recommended you do this whenever you save a Bookmarklet!</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Manbearpixel/PoloniexShowBTCWorth" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Manbearpixel/PoloniexShowBTCWorth/PoloniexShowBTCWorth.js" target="_blank">JavaScript Source</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bookmarklet</h2>
  <p>Simply drag the button/link below into your Bookmark Toolbar and bam! It is now saved and when you click it on Poloniex it will refresh
    the value of an altcoin every 10 seconds. Please note that during that refresh buffer the altcoin price may change, which will remove the BTC/USD
    value temporarily. Do not worry, as the BTC/USD value will come back after that refresh period.</p>
